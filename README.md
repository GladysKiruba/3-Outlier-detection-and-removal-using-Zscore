# 3-Outlier-detection-and-removal-using-Zscore
Outliers are the abnormal or different from the rest of the values. This may be due to measurement error, manual error etc. These outliers affect the analysis and produce less accurate values.

Outlier detection and removal using Zscore:

This method can be used for normal distribution only and cannot be used for skewed distributions. Z score is a standard score which tells how far the data is distributed from the mean.

In normal distribution 

68% of the datas lies between -1 and +1 standard deviation, 
95% of the datas lies between -2 and +2 standard deviation,
99.7% of the datas lies between -3 and +3 standard deviation.

So when the z score of the data point is outside the range -3 and +3, it is considered to be outliers.
